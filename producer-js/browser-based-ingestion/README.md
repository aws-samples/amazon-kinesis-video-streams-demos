## KVS Browser-based Ingestion ##


There has been customer asks for sending video streams from browser to KVS. Browser environment is attractive to some customers because of its ubiquity and ease of deployment. The current solution that we recommend to customers is sending MKV files to S3 and using a lambda to do putMedia there. However, orchestrating this solution is not simple for customers as they need to do some heavy processing to get the audio and video data in browser, package it into MKV, and write lambdas for uploading to S3 and KVS. This solution is also slow - writing in S3 and having to use Java Producer SDK in lambda being long poles. 

The aim of this project is to send audio and video stream from camera and microphone from your browser into a KVS stream without a proxy server or lambda. While doing so, ensuring that the video is in MKV format, uses H.264 codec for video and AAC for audio. 

Currently available via Chrome, there four important tasks that this repository helps perform
1. Obtaining the video from the webcam/ uploading video file
2. Converting it to containers and codecs expected by the playback
3. Sending to the putMedia API via POST calls
4. Viewing the stream on the browser


### Setup ###

1. Clone the repository as
```
    git clone https://github.com/aws-samples/amazon-kinesis-video-streams-demos.git
```

2. Go to `browser-based-ingestion` folder. Add the `lib` and `src` folders from that folder to your project to use this repository. Include the code from `lib` into your scripts in your HTML page with the following 
```
    <script src="../lib/aws-sdk-2.714.2.min.js"></script>
    <script src="../lib/ffmpeg.min.js"></script>
    <script src="../lib/RecordRTC.js"></script>
```
2. You can import functions from this repository as 
``` 
    import { kinesisVideo } from '../src/kinesisVideo.js'
    import { createStream } from '../src/createStream.js'
    import { getDataEndpoint } from '../src/getDataEndpoint.js'
    import { getBlobFromWebcam, getBlobFromFile, stopRecording } from '../src/getProcessedVideo.js'
    import { putMedia } from '../src/putMediaCall.js'
```

3. While adding the javascript file which uses functions from this project to script tag, please ensure that you add it with `type="module"` since `import` and `export` have been used in the underlying code for this project
```
    <script type="module" src="index.js"></script>
```

### Example ###

1. To run the example, go to `browser-based-ingestion` folder of your cloned repository and start an http-server using the following steps
```
    brew install http-server
    http-server -p 8080 -o
```
2. To view the stream, go to aws-samples.github.io/amazon-kinesis-video-streams-media-viewer/ and enter the your credentials and details of the endpoint and stream in use.

1. `getBlobFromWebcam(service, region, accessKeyID, secretAccessKey, sessionToken, dataEndpoint, streamName, audio, height, width, frameRate, latency, webcam = null)` is an asynchronous function that records video from the webcam, transforms it and sends it to the putMedia API. It can be imported as 
    `import { getBlobFromWebcam } from './src/getProcessedVideo.js'` 
    It accepts the following arguments:
```
        service: the service to send requests to
                Example: kinesisvideo
        region: the region to send service requests to. See AWS.KinesisVideo.region for more information
                Example: us-west-2 
        accessKeyID: your AWS access key ID, 
        secretAccessKey: your AWS secret access key, 
        sessionToken: the optional AWS session token to sign requests with,
        dataEndpoint: The endpoint that a service will talk to, for example, 'https://ec2.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com',
                    In this case, this is the result of the GetDataEndpoint request which returns a JSON as 
                    data = {
                        "DataEndpoint": "string"
                    } 
                    So, here the value to be sent to dataEndpoint is data.DataEndpoint or data["DataEndpoint"]
        streamName: The name of the stream to which putMedia API calls are to be made
        audio: A boolean that is set to true if you want to send audio, else false,
        height: height of the video being recorded from webcam in pixels
                Example: 480, 
        width: width of the video being recorded from webcam in pixels
                Example: 640, 
        frameRate: frame-rate of the video being recorded in frames-per-second
                Example: 30, 
        latency: frequency of putMedia API calls in milliseconds. This is also the latency of the video, since a recording of 'latency' milliseconds will be recorded before being   sent.
                Example: 2000 (for 2 seconds)
        webcam: (optional) A video element that can be used to view the stream that is being sent
                Example: <video id="webcam" width="640px" height="480px"></video>
                        const webcam = document.getElementById('webcam')
```


2. `getBlobFromFile(service, region, accessKeyID, secretAccessKey, sessionToken, dataEndpoint, streamName, inputFile, h264)` is an asynchronous function that accepts a file, transforms it to the expected format and sends it to the putMedia API. It can be imported as 
    `import { getBlobFromFile } from './src/getProcessedVideo.js'` 
    It accepts the following arguments:
```
        service: the service to send requests to
                Example: kinesisvideo
        region: the region to send service requests to. See AWS.KinesisVideo.region for more information
                Example: us-west-2 
        accessKeyID: your AWS access key ID, 
        secretAccessKey: your AWS secret access key, 
        sessionToken: the optional AWS session token to sign requests with,
        dataEndpoint: The endpoint that a service will talk to, for example, 'https://ec2.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com',
                    In this case, this is the result of the GetDataEndpoint request which returns a JSON as 
                    data = {
                        "DataEndpoint": "string"
                    } 
                    So, here the value to be sent to dataEndpoint is data.DataEndpoint or data["DataEndpoint"]
        streamName: A name for the stream that you are creating. (The stream name is an identifier for the stream, and must be unique for each account and region),
        inputFile: The file that is to be streamed by sending it to putMedia API
                    Example: <input type="file" name="inputFile" id = "inputFile">
                            const inputFile = document.getElementById('inputFile').files[0] 
        inputFiletype: A boolean that is set to true if the video uploaded contains H.264 frames, else set to false
                        Please note that if the video is not MKV or WebM with H.264 frames then the transformation will require transcoding of the frames and may take considerable amount of time.
```
